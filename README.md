<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This application is a cross-platform desktop tool designed to help users retain knowledge more effectively through spaced repetition. By utilizing scientifically backed principles of memory retention, it optimizes the learning process by reviewing information at intervals just before it's forgotten.

Key features:
* Efficient Learning: Reviews material at intervals based on your progress, ensuring optimal retention.
* Customizable Content: Great for learning a new language, as well as inputting other types of material, from academic subjects to technical skills.
* Progress Tracking: Monitor your performance and focus on areas that need improvement.
* Offline Capability: No internet connection required, providing flexibility to learn anywhere.
